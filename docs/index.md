# IOInfoExtensions
This contains some quality of life improvements to the [*System.IO.DirectoryInfo*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directoryinfo) and [*System.IO.FileInfo*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.fileinfo) classes that I find useful.

The core code is written for DotNet but I also created a PowerShell wrapper that creates a PowerShell module so it can be used there as well.
